A courier service program was created based on this program.

In this program, it is basically a program between a food processor and a food delivery company.
The main purpose of the program is to make the company's restaurant and its branches convenient for a single user, so that restaurant managers can organize food menus for their restaurants and branches.

The sequence of work is as follows:

1. The owner of the company creates a separate admin for each restaurant and a separate admin for branches.

2. Restaurant managers organize staff for this restaurant and create a menu for meals.

3. In a user-friendly program, they will be able to choose a restaurant near them and order through all its menus.
